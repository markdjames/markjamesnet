Day 2 – Portland
Posted on 7 Aug ’11	

First time out on the open road today. But before we left Seattle we travelled north out of the city centre to the Fremont Bridge to see the Fremont Troll.Then we set off on the road to Portland. It was pretty much just one straight road all the way there; Interstate 5. 3 hours later we arrived, parked up and went in to our hotel – a great little place with rock themed artwork all over the place (in a surpisingly tasteful way…)

Special mention for the man at the bottom of the photo - legend
Next we walked across town to the Saturday Market. Essentially a big hippy market but a good thing to see.Once we were done there we caught the tram back across town and out to Washington Park where we walked to the top of the hill to see the view.

You can't quite see it in the photo but thats Mt. St. Helens in the background there....
