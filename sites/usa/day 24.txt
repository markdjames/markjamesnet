Day 24 – Philadelphia
Posted on 1 Sep ’11	

As we left the hotel in the morning we saw the aftermath of the hurricane. Washington had only been on the edge of the storm but a few trees had come down and branches littered the street. As we drove we noticed there were patches were the power was out, and as we tried to find somewhere for breakfast we found queues out of the door in all the restaurants with power. We eventually found a Denny’s with a (relatively) short queue and stopped for awhile.We arrived in Philadelphia and had a small drive around the west-side of the city and down by the flooded river. It looked like a really nice city full of great looking buildings.We got to our bed and breakfast to find that there was no sign outside advertising the fact it was a bed and breakfast, and no answer when we knocked on the door. Eventually, after a little confusion, the door was answered (the b&b owner had been upstairs). It was basically her house – she showed us round and talked and talked and talked. We eventually managed to get our stuff in and get back out the door to drive back in to the downtown area for another look around.We walked up and down South Street (uninspiring for the most part) before we drove to find the two competing ‘orginal’ Philly Steak and Chesse’ sandwiches which are located opposite each other. We intended to try both. The first (Pat, King of Steaks) is understated and is pretty much universally agreed to be the first place in Philadelphia that sold steak sandwiches. We asked for the standard “Steak wit wizz” (steak, fried onions and the plasticy liquid canned cheese). The second place (Geno’s) was covered in masses of neon signs, and claims to have been the first place to offere cheese on the steak sandwich. Here we go their standard, steak with onions and provolone cheese. The quality seemed better in the second place, but I didn’t want to judge due to the different cheeses…
