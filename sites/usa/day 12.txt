Day 12 – Phoenix to El Paso
Posted on 21 Aug ’11	

It seems there really is very little to see in Phoenix, which was lucky really as we had to set off early for El Paso. We hit the road at dawn to get in a couple of hours before breakfast.It was an uneventful drive on one straight road through New Mexico – massive flat plains with hazy mountains on the horizon in all directions.We reached El Paso by 2pm and found our hotel was a pretty classy place – certianly not like the motels we’ve become accoustomed too! El Paso seems like a nice place – we drove up in to the hills to take in the scenic drive that overlooks the city and visited a interesting little thrift store.We spent a couple of hours at the rooftop pool at the hotel before heading out to the Cincinnati Entertainment District for dinner – there was a concert on at the nearby stadium so parking proved difficult, but eventually we managed it and had a great dinner. (We found out the next day that two people were shot here later on the same night – perhaps El Paso isn’t as nice as it appears?)
