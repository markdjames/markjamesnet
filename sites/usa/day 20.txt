Day 20 / 21 – Smoky Mountains / Gatlinburg / Pigeon Forge
Posted on 1 Sep ’11	

It was a four hour drive from Nashville to our cabin in the Smoky Mountains. We knew that Gatlinburg was an American tourist destination, but we were still suprised by how mad this place was – driving through Sevierville, Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg was like driving through a down-market Las Vegas with mini-golf, go-karting tracks, restaurants and ‘wacky’ attractions lined the road.We stopped off at Walmart on the way to our cabin to get some food for the barbeque. When we got to the cabin we spent some time admiring the view and walking around the area, rock-jumping through a stream.We returned to the cabin and ate good food, watched the sun go down over the mountains, played some pool and chilled out in the hottub. A really nice evening!The next day we had planned to visit Dollywood which was 20 minutes away from our cabin – sadly the American school holidays had ended and the park was no longer open on Thursday… so we made do with playing around in Pigeon Forge. We went go-karting, took a hideously over-priced ride on a Jurassic Park theme ride (essentially an overblown ghost train) and then went to a weird place with a hall of mirrors, a ‘lazer challenge’, black-light mini-golf and, to top it all off a real life magic quest… where you got a magic wand and walked around flicking your wand at things to solve quests etc. It was, of course, aimed at kids, but was good fun anyway. Becca managed to get the fastest time ever on the Lazer challenge (walking through a hall of lazers like a cat-burglar, I think I got an all time low score, it was clearly rigged).We went for a really nice steak before heading back to the cabin for an early night before our final long drive tomorrow.
