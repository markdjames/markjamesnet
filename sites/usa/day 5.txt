Day 5 – San Francisco
Posted on 12 Aug ’11	

Today we enjoyed a small lie in before walking down the road to a local diner for breakfast, after which we caught the tram back into the centre of the city to do the touristy things. We had to queue up for ages to get on the tram, but it was just about worth it – the views are amazing almost everywhere in San Francisco, but the tram really makes the most of it – and riding while hanging off the side of it is pretty fun.Once we were down to the Fisherman’s Wharf area we visited a small museum of early arcade machines; played a bit of Pong and looked at the freakish machines such as this one…We then walked along the docks overlooking Alcatraz and went to see the Sea Lions that have taken up residence there before Samantha and I indulged in a “Mimosa” (i’d never heard of it before, but its basically Buck’s Fizz) and an Oyster. I took a lot of persuading to eat mine but got there in the end (once enough horseradish and hot sauce had been put on it to take away any actual oyster flavour… I’m a heathen I know).Then it was off to the famous Lombard street – the curving, flower decorated street that overcomes one of the cities steepest hills. We foolishly decided to walk there from the bottom of the hill. In a city full of steep hills, climbing one of the steepest is no small feat. We got there in the end and join the surreal scene of hundreds of other tourists taking a photo of a road.We then jumped on a bus over towards the Golden Gate Bridge, but by that time the sea mist had rolled in and you could hardly see the bridge at all, so we walked up yet another steep, tree-lined path and caught another bus down to the Haight area – apparently the place that the hippy movement of the 60's was centred around.It was a nice area full interesting of places to eat, drink and shop so we stayed awhile before jumping on the final bus of the day to get back to the coast near our hotel in time to see the sunset over the Pacific before heading home for an early night.
