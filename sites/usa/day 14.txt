Day 14 – San Antonio to Cat Springs
Posted on 26 Aug ’11	

The hangovers were in full-effect this morning, despite the fact we’d had plenty of sleep. After allowing enough time to sober up we got back on the road headed for a ranch near Cat Springs, a small town an hour west of Houston.After a mildly stressful experience trying to get out of San Antonio (confusing satnav plus confusing freeways equals lots of confusion), it was a simple and relatively short trip to the ranch. It was a really ncie little cabin in the middle of nowhere.We walked around the ranch, suffering under the unrelenting sun, but enjoying the quiet all the same. Afterwards we lazed around, cooked good food and generally did very little for a change.(photos to come on this one – my camera being temporarily out of order on this day….)
