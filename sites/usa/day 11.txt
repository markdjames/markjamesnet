Day 11 – Las Vegas to Phoenix
Posted on 21 Aug ’11	

Back on the road for another long drive today – entering in to what promises to be the hardest part of journey, covering 1500 miles in 3 days. We drove out of Vegas and stopped at the Hover Dam breifly before joining Route 66 at Kingsman for an hour or two untill we reached the Roadkill Cafe; suprisingly, for a place who’s moto is ‘you kill it, we grill it’, the food was great!The drive down to Phoenix took us into Disney looking landscapes of huge boulders and cartoon cactuses. This is real cowboy country.We eventually arrived around 8.30pm (having lost an hour due to timezone changes en route) only to find that seemibngly eveny resturant in Phoenix closes at 9pm, so by the time we’d checked in to our motel there was no time to eat. Lucky we’d had a big dinner…
