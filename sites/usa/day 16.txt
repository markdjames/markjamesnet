Day 16 – New Orleans
Posted on 27 Aug ’11	

Today was my birthday, we had a lazy morning before walking the short walk into the historic, and famous, French Quarter. We walked around just enjoying the atmosphere; it was very touristy but there was still a buzz in the air, musicians playing on many street corners, each building decorated differently and bubbles floated through the air. And it was HOT. This wasn’t like the desert, here we were sweating buckets and diving in to air-conditioned shops at every available opportunity.We booked ourselves in for a ride on a steamboat cruise up and down the Mississippi. While we waited we were subjected to a women playing the most horrendous sounding instrument – a organ like device plugged directly into the steamboat; essentially tuned boat whistles. It went on and on with its ear-piercing renditions of honky-tonk classics. That combined with the heat put us all on edge, but it eventually stopped and we got in the shade on the boat and all was well again.The boat trip itself was… well, not disappointing as we didn’t expect much, but the river around New Orleans is very industrial – so not the greatest of scenery. But still, it was great to be on a real steam-paddler and listening to some live (this time on proper instruments) honkytonk.After the boat trip we slowly wandered back through the old French market on the way back to our apartment. We spent a few hours lounging in our little pool before heading back out for a ‘traditional Louisiana meal’ – Gumbo, Etouffee, Jambalaya, Shrimp Creole and Red Beans & Rice (apparently considered the best cuisine in America, it was nice but a little disappointing, being mostly made up of soupy/stew like dishes).

Sam hates trumpets...
After dinner we walked down the famous Bourbon Street only to find it was incredibly tacky and full of stag and hen parties – so we headed back to the much nicer Frenchmen Street and visited a few of the bars around there.
