Day 7/8 – Los Angeles
Posted on 14 Aug ’11	

First stop was Du Par’s 24 hour breakfast diner, where we had their “world famous” (as a lot of things seem to be around here) pancakes. They were huge and really good, but by the end I never wanted to see another pancake.We then drove to the airport so we could pick up my birthday present from Samantha – an amazing 24 hours with a Mustang GT. So excited.We split up for the rest of the day, Samantha and I went driving round in the Mustang, taking in Venice Beach, Malibu, Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, the Hollywood foothills (including the Hollywood sign), Mulholland Drive (possibly one of the greatest roads to drive on ever) and Rodeo Drive.In the evening we met up again and went to Brennan’s Irish pub to see the turtle racing. A very weird evening watching turtles race out of a circle…The next day was spent mostly doing some much needed chilling out. We went for lunch at Phillipes, a place famous for their French Dip sandwiches. And famous seems to be no exaggeration here, the place was heaving. A French Dip sandwich is one that has been ‘double dipped’ in the gravy of the meat. It was incredibly tasty, but incredibly fatty too.In the afternoon we walked to McArthur Park through one of the many dodgy areas of Los Angeles, past countless 99 cent stores, swap meets and to the soundtrack as police helicopters flew overhead. Los Angeles is, for the most part, a pretty rough looking city.In the evening we went to the Los Angeles County Art Museum to see the brilliant Tim Burton exhibition, had a look around the tar pits and watched Burton’s film James and the Giant Peach with a picnic out in the museum grounds.
