Day 18 – Memphis
Posted on 29 Aug ’11	

In the morning the bar below, (called ‘Ground Zero’) was open from 11 so we went in for some morning cake and to look around the place. It was very cool inside, with graffiti all over the walls (as it was outside too) and guitars and other memorabelia litered all over the place.It was a short drive to Memphis. We walked from our motel in to the downtown area, first stop was Sun Studios – the place that Elvis recorded his first ever song (and many others after) and also where the likes of Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Howlin’ Wolf and many others had worked and performed. We paid for a guided tour and were shown around by a slightly crazy seeming guy…When it was over we walked the rest of the way to Beale Street, the famous entertainment district. Memphis was a real dump, much of the sidewalk was broken up and over grown with bushes and weeds and we walked past broken down old vehicles and empty lots before suddenly coming across the neon lit street.We went in to BB Kings Blues bar and had some beer while listening to a blues band play on stage. We then went for a traditional ‘Memphis Bar-B-Q’. I ate so much I could barely move. We then got a taxi home, driven by possibly the coolest man I’ve ever met – a huge black guy who laid back in his seat, singing blues under his breath inbetween coming out with some great turns of phrase in his brilliant accent.
