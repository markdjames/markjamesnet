Day 1 – Seattle
Posted on 6 Aug ’11	

A busy first day making the most of our short time in Seattle.Started with a walk to the Seattle Center to see the Space Needle. Went to the top and enjoyed the view. Took the monorail back in to the downtown area and walked down to “the famous” Pike Place Market. Wandered around looking at all the amazing food and the original Starbucks. Sat down for a great lunch and then decided to buy some fresh prawns to make for dinner. Proceeded to almost buy $86 worth of prawns due to not understanding the Ibs. measurements… had a quick, embarrassed, frankly kind of pathetic huddle before making our excuses and a hasty exitWe went to a great toy shop and Sam found a new friend…So did Samantha…Next it was the tour of the old underground side streets of Seattle, where our guide Stephen took us through all these underground tunnels and told us about the history of Seattle. Interesting guy. Sam told him he loved him.
