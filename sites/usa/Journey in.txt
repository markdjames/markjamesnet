Journey in…
Posted on 5 Aug ’11	

It took 26 hours, but we finally arrived in Seattle at midnight (local time) last night.Spent several hours in Dallas, enough time to visit a shopping mall and experience the 40+ degree heat. Never felt anything like it!Sadly we didn’t have enough change to go on the ‘hurricane experience ride’ in the mall, but seeing the huge range of fast foods available was an experience in itself….Woke up early this morning and just had one of the best coffees of my life in a little place called Bedlam just up the street from our hostel.
