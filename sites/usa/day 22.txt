Day 22 / 23 – Washington D.C.
Posted on 1 Sep ’11	

We set off early on the 8 hour drive to Washington – half way through the drive we stopped off in a little place near Lexington, Virginia to spend a couple of hours floating down the James River on a big rubber ring. A nice break from the driving.We arrived in Washington in the evening and went for some Thai food – a nice break from all the American food we’d been having for the last few weeks. After we went to a bar and had some super-strength Long Island Ice Teas.The next day Hurricane Irene started to show her face in Washington – the rain started in the morning and steadily increased throughout the day. We walked down 16th Ave. to the Whitehouse (smaller than it looks on TV) and then across past the Washington Monument over to the WWII memorial – here we found out that they are currently digging up the iconic reflecting pools (disappointing) but we walked along to the Lincoln Memorial to see him sat in his big chair.Thoroughly wet by this point Samantha and I caught a taxi to Union Station to find some food before heading back out to see Capitol Hill, the Botanical Gardens and past all the Smithsonian museums.As the weather closed in we headed back to the hotel for a nap before heading out again in the evening for some food – the wind was picking up but places were still open thankfully.
