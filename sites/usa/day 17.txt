Day 17 – New Orleans to Clarksdale
Posted on 27 Aug ’11	

I woke with a terrible hangover – the joint result of dehydration and mixing drinks. I eventually worked up the energy to crawl out of bed and we went across the road to a very popular little local bakery that served breakfast. It was full of locals and we had to queue to sit down, but it was worth it and got me feeling alive again.On the way out of New Orleans we stopped briefly at one of the many cemetaries with all the above ground crypts before heading out and up in to Mississippi.Mississppi proved to be endless, flat farmland – we left the interstate and drove on endless deserted roads past cotton fields and trailer parks until we reached Clarksdale around dusk. This is the town billed as the home of the Blues, where many famous musicians were born and raised. We were staying in a apartment above the ‘juk joint’ owned by Morgan Freeman. as we approched the building we thought we must be in the wrong place, it was a big warehouse like place in middle of a run down industrial area at the end of the street, but this was it. Sadly the place was closed, but we got in to our place (which was actually very nice) and headed out for some dinner at a suprisingly nice local pizza place.
