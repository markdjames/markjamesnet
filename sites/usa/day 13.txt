Day 13 – El Paso to San Antonio
Posted on 26 Aug ’11	

Another early start as we got underway on the longest single drive of the trip, almost two-thirds of the way across Texas – over 500 miles. It was as we expected, the landscape was bleak and desolate. There weren’t even many road-side services.It was a long and uneventful journey, but by 6pm we had arrived in San Antonio. Our hotel was a 5 minute walk from the focal ‘river walk’ area – an attractive (although touristy) area along the banks of the river that runs through the centre of the city. We walked along there before heading 10 minutes further south to a Mexican restaurant which we had been recommended by a women in El Paso who used to live in the city.The place was packed and had a good atmosphere. The food was… interesting; I guess this is real Mexican food, but it was mostly far too salty. After the food we walked back to the river and had one drink in a riverside bar before going to a local club which had live music downstairs and a couple of dance floors upstairs. We drank good tequila and ridiculously strong hurricanes and danced like a group of English people while the locals looked on with bemusement. Apparently American’s don’t dance like us….We walked back to the hotel and sat with our legs dangling in the pool. Before long I ended up in the pool, fully clothed, with my phone, camera and wallet in my pockets. Apparently I wasn’t clear I had these things on me before Sam pushed me in… within a few minutes everyone was in the pool – everyone else having been fortunate enough to remove all electrical goods from their pockets before entering.P.S. the camera came back to life after drying out, the phone came back for a while before the screen gave up entirely. The money had to be dried with a hairdryer.
