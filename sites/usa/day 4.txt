Day 4 – Crescent City to San Fransisco
Posted on 10 Aug ’11	

The morning’s weather was identical to the night before, and as we left town up into the redwood state park we drove in to thick fog, but even that couldn’t hide the spectacular scenery around us.We stopped at a tourist spot called the Trees of Mystery, with a giant ‘living’ statue of the American folk legend Paul Bunyan. He spoke to people who were taking photos of him. Very surreal. We went up into the forest and saw the giant trees, then drove a few miles further down the highway to one of the ‘drive-thru’ trees for another photo opportunity.Then we were off for the long haul to San Fransisco, 350 miles south. The road, US Highway 101 was incredible, a real treat to drive on. We stopped a couple of times, in Eureka and some other small town I didn’t catch the name of, before We eventually stopped about 100 miles north of San Francisco for some really tasty dinner in Ukaih (thanks for the tip Marina).Just over an hour later we crossed over the Golden Gate Bridge and in to San Francisco as the sun was setting. An amazing sight.After checking in to our hotel near the beach we took the tram in to the centre of town, picked a random stop and got off looking for somewhere to have a drink. It soon became apparent we had picked the wrong spot, so we hailed a taxi and asked him to take us somewhere cool. He took us to the Mission district where we had a drink in a very cool little back room of a bar called the Hideaway which had low lighting and swing music playing.Finally, to end a long day, we got a taxi back to the hotel, strangely enough I ended up having to direct the taxi driver despite having only been in the city a couple of hours. Went to sleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.
