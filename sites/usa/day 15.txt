Day 15 – Cat Springs to New Orleans
Posted on 26 Aug ’11	

We sat around the kitchen table and had breakfast before packing the car and heading back to the interstate towards New Orleans. We stopped at a Texas cowboy boot shop in Houston so Becca and Samantha could indulge in some retail therapy.We had booked ourselves on a Louisiana swamp (or Bayou) tour at 5pm, we arrived just in time at the location in a small town called Beaux Bridge. A really interesting looking place. As we got out we noticed the humidity had noticably risen and suddenly we were in creepy-crawly territory. We found a big spider; I lent against a tree only to find it infested with ants three times the size of our English variety; We then spotted what can only be discribed as ginormous red ant, at leats 10 times the size of the average. Terrifying.We soon met our guide and jumped in his little metal boat and set out on to the bayou. It was a 2 hour trip filled with sightings of aligators, large birds, big dragonflies and giant spiders. Basically big animals of all sorts. It was absolutely fascinating and an amazing experience that can’t really be put in to words.Once the trip was over we headed on to New Orleans. As we hit the interstate the sky broke and monsoon like rain came down while fork lighting split the horizon; dusk quickly turned in to darkness which made the going a little slower than normal.we eventually arrived in the New Orleans around 9, got the keys to our little apartment and literally followed our ears down the road as the sound of musicians playing in the street took us towards a road (we would later find out it was Frenchmen Street) where a small but lively stretch of bars were full of people playing and listening to music in the beautiful French colonial style streets – it was a pretty magical experience.
