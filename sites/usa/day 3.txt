Day 3 – Portland to Crescent City
Posted on 10 Aug ’11	

We left Portland early, deciding to have breakfast on the road. We stopped off at a Denny’s resturant to get an American breakfast.It was a 4 hour drive on Interstate 5 until we turned off on to the road to the coast, Redwood Avenue. Just before leaving the Interstate we stopped for some ‘gas’ at a place called Wolf Creek – after filling up we went down to the river itself and spent some time in the sun and talked to the park warden.The road through the Illinois valley was a fantastic driving experience, slicing through some postcard Americana towns before rising up into the redwood covered mountains on the border between Oregon and California.Once through the hills we dropped down on to the coast, leaving the bright sunshine behind and into misty Crescent City. The name is a little misleading – its essentially a small fishing town. We stopped at the Curly Redwood Lodge, where all the wood used in the construction was, apparently, taken from one Giant Redwood.We went for a walk out in to the fishing docks and saw seals and pelicans in the harbour before going for some dinner.
