Day 19 – Nashville
Posted on 29 Aug ’11	

Before we left Memphis we drove past the memorial center to Martin Luther King Jr. / National Civil Rights museum – sadly it was closed…Nashville was a 3.5 hour drive away, we arrived in early afternoon all suffering with food hangovers and desperate for some salad, so before checking in we went to an all your can eat salad bar and getting some vitamins back.We went to our hotel and spent some time in the pool before heading in to the cities bar district (it seems to be all about the music around here, so this seemed the natural place to head). It was certainly one of the nicest bar districts we’d seen – far nicer than Bourbon Street in New Orleans and prettier than Beale Street in Memphis. We walked along listening to the live country music eminating from almost every bar as doormen dressed as cowboys lined the street. It was a good atmosphere.We weren’t in the mood to drink so we just enjoyed the atmosphere for a while before heading back and to bed.
