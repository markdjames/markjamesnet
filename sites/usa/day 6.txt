Day 6 – San Francisco to Los Angeles
Posted on 14 Aug ’11	

We woke up early and left San Francisco on Highway 1. After a couple of hours driving we stopped in Santa Cruz for breakfast. It was suprisingly cold, but seemed like a nice town all the same.After a nice breakfast we left for the long drive along the Pacific coast, a famous drive full of more amazing views across the ocean, the road twisting and turning along cliff edges and over high bridges and through the Big Sur national park.We stopped off briefly to see some Elephant Seals sleeping on one of the beaches.After hours of driving we stopped in the afternoon for a couple of hours in Santa Barbra, a beauitful town between the ocean and mountains. We walked along the pier and paddled in the ocean.100 miles more and we arrived in the huge sprawl of Los Angeles as the sun was coming down, hitting the first bit of real traffic we had experienced so far.We eventually made it to our motel exhusted and went to bed early.
