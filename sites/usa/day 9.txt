Day 9/10 – Las Vegas
Posted on 21 Aug ’11	

We left Los Angeles as the sun was rising in order the reach Las Vegas at a good time. Aside from stopping for breakfast it was an uneventful journey, although it was our first sight of desert and like driving on some alien planet (the photo doesn’t do it justice at all).As we reached the Las Vegas city limits too all our suprises it started to rain. In the middle of a desert it rained. We drove out on to the strip and saw all the hotels and got a small tasteb of how crazy this place really is.Despite the rain it was seriously hot. By the time we had checked in the rain had ended and after a couple of hours rest we headed off back to the strip.It’s hard really to put this place in to words – its everything I expected it to be and utterly shocking at the same time. The hotels are inconceivably huge, the money changing hands is mind numbing – the streets throng with hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world; families with young children rub shoulders with stag parties; catalogues advertising prostitutes are avaliable on every street corner away from the strip, and on the strip hundreds of men and women try to force the same catalogues straight in to your hands; scantily clad women stand outside all-day nightclubs in the middle of luxury shopping centres drapped in crystal chandaliers while people line the bars and slot machines at every turn.The evening was spent the only way you can really spend an evening here – getting drunk, and as the saying goes, ‘what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas’…The next day was spent relaxing by/in the pool or in the cool of the room (being 100+ degrees Fahrenheit outside). In the evening we ventured back on the strip to see the canals at the Venetian hotel, the Sirens of Treasure Island (an incredibly bad pirate show outside the Treasure Island casino, made even worse by the fact it broke down half way through), and finally the fountains at the Bellagio – which were actually worth watching – hugh fountains shooting up in time to Elvis’s Viva Las Vegas.
